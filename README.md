Various stand-alone scripts for python.

* **sex.py** - A script that generates a random nsfw provacitive reply. Ported from a Linux command. Not exactly sure where said command source is.

* **pirate.py** - A script that translates any input into Pirate language. Use with single quotes to prevent escaping. e.g. /path/to/pirate.py 'something something'
